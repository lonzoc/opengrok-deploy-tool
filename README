Download source code into a single directory located under /var/opengrok/src/
	e.g. 
	cd /var/opengrok/src
	git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git

2. Deploy source code
The opengrok-deploy.sh located under /var/opengrok/ directory is used for deploying
a new source code project, you must run as root to execute this script.

sudo /var/opengrok/opengrok-deploy.sh <directory-name-of-the-new-project>

	e.g.

Upgrading opengrok index
-------------------------

The opengrok-deploy.sh will do the first index for the source code, if you need to
upgrade your source code you may try opengrok-index.sh.

Generally, there are two steps:1. upgrade your source code; 2. run opengrok-index.sh to start indexing.
